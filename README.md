# A Demo of a React App that uses TypeScript and Chakra UI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to Create a Repo with TypeScript and Chakra UI

### Only relevant if you want to create your own project and don't want to just clone down this one

- Create a new repo on GitHub
- Clone the new repo and navigate to that folder in your terminal
- Create a React App w/ TypeScript: `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`
- Install Chakra UI: `npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion`
- Remove `src/App.css` and `src/index.css` (remove the actual files and the imports also)
- Add a Chakra Provider to `App.tsx` - see an example in [their documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
